Instructions

• Online submission: You must submit your solutions online on the course Gradescope site (you can find a link on the course Brightspace site). You need to submit (1) a PDF that contains the solutions to all questions to the Gradescope HW3 Paperwork assignment (including the questions asked in the programming problems), (2) x.py or x.ipynb files for the programming questions to the Gradescope HW3 Code Files assignment. We recommend that you type the solution (e.g., using LATEX or Word), but we will accept scanned/pictured solutions as well (clarity matters).

• Generative AI Policy: You are free to use any generative AI, but you are required to document the usage: which AI do you use, and what’s the query to the AI. You are responsible for checking the correctness.

Before you start: this homework only has programming problems. You should still have all questions answered in the write-up pdf. Also note that some sub-problems are still essentially math problems and you need to show detailed derivations.

1 Programming Problem: Logistic Regression [40 points]

In this problem, you will implement the gradient descent algorithm and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm for multi-class logistic regression from scratch (which means that you cannot use builtin logistic regression modules in scikit-learn or any other packages). Then you will be asked to try your implementation on a hand-written digits dataset to recognize the hand-written digits in given images.

We provide an ipython notebook “logistic regression digits.ipynb” for you to complete. You need to complete the scripts below “TODO” (please search for every “TODO”), and submit the completed ipynb file. In your write-up, you also need to include the plots and answers to the questions required in this session.

In this problem, you will implement a logistic regression model for multi-class classification. Given features of a sample x, a multi-class logistic regression produces class probability (i.e., the probability of the sample belonging to class k)

xW b z

Pr((1)

where c is the number of all possible classes, model parameter W is a d × c matrix and b is a c-dim vector, and we call the c values in z = xW +b as the c logits associated with the c classes. Binary logistic regression model (c = 2) is a special case of the above multi-class logistic regression model (you can figure out why by yourself with a few derivations). The predicted class ˆy of x is

yˆ = arg max Pr(y = k|x;W,b). (2)

k=1,2,···,c

For simplicity of implementation, we can extend each x by adding an extra dimension with value 1, i.e., x ← [x,1], and accordingly add an extra row to W, i.e, W ← [W;b].

After using the extended representation of x and W, the logits z become z = xW. Logistic regression solves the following optimization for maximum likelihood estimation.

minF(W) wherelog[Pr(, (3)

W

where we use a regularization similar to the ℓ2-norm in ridge regression, i.e., the Frobenius norm ∥W∥2F = . Note that W·,j is the jth column of W.

1. [15 points] Derive the gradient of F(W) w.r.t. W, i.e., ∇WF(W), and write down the gradient descent rule for W. Hint: compute the gradient w.r.t. to each Wj for every class j first.

2. [10 points] Below “2 batch gradient descent (GD) for Logistic regression”, implement the batch gradient descent algorithm with a constant learning rate. To avoid numerical problems when computing the exponential in the probability Pr(y = k|x;W,b), you can use a modification of the logits z′, i.e.,

z′ = z − maxzj. (4)

j

Explain why such a modification could avoid potential numerical problems and show that the overall result is unchanged by applying such a trick.

When the change of objective F(W) comparing to F(W) in the previous iteration is less than ϵ = 1.0e − 4, i.e., |Ft(W) − Ft−1(W)| ≤ ϵ, stop the algorithm. Please record the value of F(W) after each iteration of gradient descent.

Please run the implemented algorithm to train a logistic regression model on the randomly split training set. We recommend to use η = 0.1. Try three different learning rates [5.0e − 3,1.0e − 2,5.0e − 2], report the final value of F(W) and training/test accuracy in these three cases, and draw the three convergence curves (i.e., Ft(W) vs. iteration t) in a 2D plot.

3. [5 points] Compare the convergence curves: what is the advantages and disadvantages of large and small learning rates?

4. [5 points] Below “4 stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for Logistic regression”, implement the minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for logistic regression. You can reuse some code from the previous gradient descent implementation.

You can start by using an initial learning rate of 1.0e−2 and a mini-batch size of 100 for this problem. You can discard the last mini-batch of every epoch if it is not full. Please remember to record the value of F(W) after each epoch and the final training and test accuracy.

Run your code for different mini-batch sizes: [10, 50, 100]. Report the final value of F(W) and final training/test accuracy, and draw the three convergence curves (Ft(W) vs. epoch t) in a 2D plot.

2 Programming Problem: Lasso [60 points]

You need to complete everything below each of the “TODO”s that you find (please search for every “TODO”). Once you have done that, please submit the completed ipynb file as part of your included .zip file.

In your write-up, you also need to include the plots and answers to the questions required in this session.

Please include the plots and answers in the pdf file in your solution. Recall that for lasso, we aim to solve:

argminθ,θ0F(θ,θ0) where . (5)

Remarks: Do not include θ0 in the computation of precision/recall/sparsity. However, do not forget to include it when you compute the prediction produced by the lasso model, because it is one part of the model.

1. [15 points] Implement the coordinate descent algorithm to solve the lasso problem in the notebook.

We provide a function “DataGenerator” to generate synthetic data in the notebook. Please read the details of the function to understand how the data are generated. In this problem, you need to use n = 50,m = 75,σ = 1.0,θ0 = 0.0 as input augments to the data generator. Do not change the random seed for all the problems afterwards.

Stopping criteria of the outer loop: stop the algorithm when either of the following is fulfilled: 1) the number of steps exceeds 100; or 2) no element in θ changes more than ϵ between two successive iterations of the outer loop, i.e., maxj |θj(t)−θj(t−1)| ≤ ϵ, where the recommended value for ϵ = 0.01, where θj(t) is the value of θj after t iterations.

At the beginning of the lasso, use the given initialization function “θ,θ0 = Initialw(X, y)” to initialize θ and θ0 by the least square regression or ridge regression.

You can try different values of λ to make sure that your solution makes sense to you (Hint: DataGenerator gives the true θ and θ0).

Solve lasso on the generated synthetic data using the given parameters and report indices of non-zero weight entries. Plot the objective value F(θ,θ0) v.s. coordinate descent step. The objective value should always be non-increasing.

2. [5 points] Implement an evaluation function in the notebook to calculate the precision and recall of the non-zero indices of the lasso solution with respect to the non-zero indices of the true vector that generates the synthetic data. Precision and recall are useful metrics for many machine learning tasks. For this problem in specific,

|{non-zero indices in θˆ} ∩ {non-zero indices in θ∗}| precision = ;

|{non-zero indices in θˆ}| (6)

|{non-zero indices in θˆ} ∩ {non-zero indices in θ∗}|

recall = non-zero indices in θ∗}| ,

|{ (7)

where θ∗ is the θ in true model weight, while θˆ is the θ in lasso solution.

3. [10 points] Vary λ and solve the lasso problem multiple times. Choose 50 evenly spaced λ values starting with λmax = ∥(y − y¯)X∥∞ (¯y is the average of elements in y, and ∥a∥∞ = maxj aj), and ending with λmin = 0. Plot the precision v.s. λ and recall v.s. λ curves on a single 2D plot. Briefly explain the plotted pattern and curves. On top of this, try to have fun with λ and play with this hyperparameter, explore, discover, and tell us what you have discovered.

Draw a “lasso solution path” for each entry of θ in a 2D plot. In particular, use λ as the x-axis, for each entry θi in θ achieved by lasso, plot the curve of θi vs. λ for all the values of λ you tried similar to the plot we showed in class from the Murphy text (in your case, there are 50 points on the curve). Draw such curves for all the m entries in θ within a 2D plot, use the same color for the 5 features in DataGenerator used to generate the data, and use another very noticeably distinct color for other features. If necessary, set a proper ranges for x-axis and y-axis, so you can see sufficient detail.

Now change the noise’s standard deviation σ = 10.0 when using “DataGenerator” to generate synthetic data, draw the lasso solution path again. Compare the two solution path plots with different σ, and explain their difference. Be complete, and clear.

4. [5 points] Use the synthetic data generation code with different parameters: (n = 50,m = 75),(n = 50,m = 150),(n = 50,m = 1000),(n = 100,m = 75),(n = 100,m = 150),(n = 100,m = 1000) (keeping other parameters the same as in Sub-Problem 1). Vary λ in the same way as in the previous question (Sub-Problem 3), and find the λ value that can generate both good precision and recall for each set of synthetic data points.

For each case, draw the “lasso solution path” defined in Sub-Problem 3.

5. [25 points] This question is challenging, requiring major changes to your previous implementation as well as significant training time. Run lasso to predict review stars on Yelp by selecting important features (words) from review comments. We provide the data in hw3 data.zip. You can unzip the file and use the provided function “DataParser” in the notebook to load the data. There are three files: “star data.mtx”, “star labels.txt”, “star features.txt”. The first file stores a matrix market matrix and DataParser reads it into a scipy csc sparse matrix, which is your data matrix

X. The second file contains the labels, which are the stars of comments on Yelp, is your y. The third file contains the names of features (words). For the last two txt files, you can open them in an editor and take a look at their contents.

The sparse data X has size 45000 × 2500, and is split into the training set (the first 30000 samples), validation set (the following 5000 samples) and the test set (the last 10000 samples) by “DataParse”. Each column corresponds to a feature, i.e., a word appearing in the comments. Your mission is to solve lasso on the training set, tune the λ value to find the best RMSE on the validation set, and evaluate the performance of the obtained lasso model on the test set.

Important to read before you start: Here, we are dealing with a sparse data matrix. Most numpy operations for dense matrices you used for implementing lasso in Sub-Problem 1 cannot be directly applied to sparse matrices here. You can still use the framework you got in Sub-Problem 1, but you need to replace some dense matrix operations (multiply, dot, sum, slicing, etc.) by using sparse matrix operations from “scipy.sparse” (please refer to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/ reference/sparse.html for details of sparse matrix operations).

The sparse matrix format here aims to help you make the algorithm more efficient in handling sparse data. Do not try to directly transform the sparse matrix X to a dense one by using “X.todense()”, since it will waste too much memory. Instead, try to explore the advantages of different sparse matrix types (csc, coo, csr) and avoid their disadvantages, which are listed under each sparse matrix type in the above link. You can change the format of a sparse matrix X to another one by using (for example) “X.tocsc()” if necessary, but do not use it too often. For some special sparse matrix operations, it might be more efficient to write it by yourself. We provide an example “cscMatInplaceEleMultEveryRow” in the notebook. You can use it, or modify it for your own purpose.

This will be a good practice for you to think about how to write an efficient ML algorithm. Try to avoid building new objects inside the loop, or computing anything from scratch. You can initialize them before the loop start, and use the lightest way to update them in the loop. Note any operation that seems “small” inside the loop could possibly lead to expensive computations, considering the total number of times it will be executed.

You can use “if” to avoid unnecessary operations on zeros. Do not loop over matrices or vectors if not necessary: use matrix or batch operations provided by numpy or scipy instead. Try to use the most efficient operation when there are many choices reaching the same result. If you write an inefficient code here, running it will take extremely longer time. During debugging, timing each step or operation in the loop will help you figure out which step takes longer time, and you can then focus on how to accelerate it.

• Explain how do you modify your implementation to make the code more efficient compared to the “naive” implementation you did for Sub-Problem 1. Compare the computational costs of every coordinate descent iteration in terms of n (number of data points) and m (number of dimensions).

• Plot the training RMSE (on the training set) v.s. λ values and validation RMSE (on the validation set) v.s. λ values on a 2D plot. Use the definition of λmax in sub-problem 3 and run experiments on multiple values of λ. You can reduce the number of different λ values to 20. You can also increase the minimal λ to be slightly larger than 0 such that 0 ≤ λmin ≤ 0.1λmax. These two changes will save you some time.

• Plot the lasso solution path defined in Sub-Problem 3.

• Report the best λ value achieving the smallest validation RMSE you find on the validation set, and report the corresponding test RMSE (on the test set).

• Report the top-10 features (words in comments) with the largest magnitude in the lasso solution w when using the best λ value, and briefly explain if/why they are meaningful.
